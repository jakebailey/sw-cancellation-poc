        <h1>Service worker cancellation proof-of-concept</h1>

        <p>
            This is a proof-of-concept for cancellation using service workers. It works by having the service worker
            intercept requests to the URLs <code>/@cancellation@/*</code>, which effectively turns the service worker
            into an HTTP server.
        </p>

        <p>
            On the worker side, a synchronous HTTP call can be used to check for cancellation, which allows
            <code>isCancellationRequested</code> checks to be made without waiting for a cancellation message to be read
            from the incoming stream (which may not be possible if the current operation is synchronous.)
        </p>

        <p>The function to check for cancellation looks roughly like:</p>

        <pre>
    function isCancellationRequested(id: rpc.CancellationId): boolean {
        const request = new XMLHttpRequest();
        request.open('GET', `/@cancellation@/${id}`, /* async */ false);
        request.send();
        return request.status === 200;
    }
        </pre>

        <p>The code for this page lives <a href="https://github.com/jakebailey/sw-cancellation-poc">here</a>.</p>

        <p>
            Below is a console log of the page and a worker communicating over JSON-RPC, making and handling a few
            requests to a number adder handler.
